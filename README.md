Project Proposal 
	The first part of the project will be a colour matching game. A circle with a certain colour and a blank circle will appear in the middle of the screen and 5-10 circles of colours below them. The user must click the colours to change the colour of the blank circle and match the middle circle. There may also be circles that will affect how dark or light the colours are. The second part will be a clicking game. The user must click as many squares that appear on the screen as they can before a timer runs out. There will also be other shapes generating and if the user clicks the other shapes it will make the timer run out faster. I may also add a score system with saving high scores. The third will be an illustration of an image that looks similar to a TARDIS from Doctor Who that will fade in and out of the screen. Each time the image fades out it will fade in somewhere else on the screen. It will either do it automatically as the page loads or there will be a button that will make the image fade in and out. 

I will need to learn how to change colours of svg elements using javascript and how to make svg elements fade in and fade out on a page. I will also need to learn how to use a timer that will speed up when certain elements are clicked. I will be using stackoverflow, W3Schools, and some javascript libraries to help me during the project.
